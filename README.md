## 🌌 Overview 
**CodeForge** contains **JavaScript** workflows designed for **HTML** environments.  
The workflows focus on interactive tools for simple 3D visualization that can be easily integrated into web pages. The repository mainly serves as a sharing space for educational and exploratory tools developed with the assistance of large language models.

Concept, design and refinement: **Gleb Novikov**  
Implementation support: **Google Gemini**


## 🔮 Available workflows ✨click to play✨
- [Antibody Visualization](https://thevisualhub.github.io/CodeForge/Workflows/antibody_visualizer.html) — robotics-inspired immunoglobulins with flexible Fab arms and thermal motion.
- [Origami Viewer](https://thevisualhub.github.io/CodeForge/Workflows/origami_viewer.html) — a lightweight playground for geometric topologies and shape-shifting via morphing.
- [3D Fire Simulation](https://thevisualhub.github.io/CodeForge/Workflows/realFIREmorph.html) — a high-fidelity kinetic fire simulation using Procedural Fluid Dynamics (Multi-Octave Simplex Noise & Blackbody Radiation physics) to recreate the fire movements and morphing without heavy computation of Navier-Stokes equations.
- [4D Protein Folding](https://thevisualhub.github.io/CodeForge/Workflows/4DProteinFolding.html) — a high-fidelity simulation engine to reveal protein folding dynamics. 4D interface allows to manipulate system temperature and stochasticity, visualizing the transition from random coils to native helical states.
